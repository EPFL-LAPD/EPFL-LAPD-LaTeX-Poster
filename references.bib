Though tomographic additive manufacturing has the potential to produce complex parts with a higher throughput and a wider range of printable materials than layer-by-layer additive manufacturing, its resolution currently remains limited to 300 µm. Here, we show that a low-étendue illumination system enables the production of high-resolution features. We further demonstrate an integrated feedback system to accurately control the photopolymerization kinetics over the entire build volume and improve the geometric fidelity of the object solidification. Hard and soft centimeter-scale parts are produced in less than 30 seconds with 80 µm positive and 500 µm negative features, thus demonstrating that tomographic additive manufacturing is potentially suitable for the ultrafast fabrication of advanced and functional constructs.},  number={11}, journal={Nature Communications}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Loterie, Damien and Delrot, Paul and Moser, Christophe}, year={2020}, month=feb, pages={852}, language={en} }

The speed, geometry, and surface quality limitations of additive processes are linked to their reliance on material layering. We demonstrated concurrent printing of all points within a three-dimensional object by illuminating a rotating volume of photosensitive material with a dynamically evolving light pattern. We printed features as small as 0.3 millimeters in engineering acrylate polymers and printed soft structures with exceptionally smooth surfaces into a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel. Our process enables us to construct components that encase other preexisting solid objects, allowing for multimaterial fabrication. We developed models to describe speed and spatial resolution capabilities and demonstrated printing times of 30 to 120 seconds for diverse centimeter-scale objects.}, number={6431}, journal={Science}, publisher={American Association for the Advancement of Science}, author={Kelly, Brett E. and Bhattacharya, Indrasen and Heidari, Hossein and Shusteff, Maxim and Spadaccini, Christopher M. and Taylor, Hayden K.}, year={2019}, month=mar, pages={1075–1079} }

Here we introduce a new, simpler approach to image-computation that algebraically optimizes a model of the printed object, significantly improving print accuracy of complex parts under imperfect material and optical precision by improving optical dose contrast between the target and surrounding regions. Quality metrics for volumetric printing are defined and shown to be significantly improved by the new algorithm. The approach is extended beyond binary printing to grayscale control of conversion to enable functionally graded materials. The flexibility of the technique is digitally demonstrated with realistic projector point spread functions, printing around occluding structures, printing with restricted angular range, and incorporation of materials chemistry such as inhibition. Finally, simulations show that the method facilitates new printing modalities such as printing into flat, rather than cylindrical packages to extend the applications of volumetric printing.}, journal={Additive Manufacturing}, author={Rackson, Charles M. and Champley, Kyle M. and Toombs, Joseph T. and Fong, Erika J. and Bansal, Vishal and Taylor, Hayden K. and Shusteff, Maxim and McLeod, Robert R.}, year={2021}, month=dec, pages={102367}, language={en} }
